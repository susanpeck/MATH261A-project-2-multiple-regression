# SJSU MATH261A Regression Analysis Project Two

MATH 261A Project 2 Repository

Author: Susan Peck

Date: November 11, 2025

## File Structure

This repository is structured as follows:

-   data - contains five .xpt files, four downloaded from NHANES 2017-2018, one a final cleaned data set

-   paper - contains a quarto document, a pdf of the final paper, and references.bib

## Data

This paper uses data from the 2017-2018 cycle of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), conducted by the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). NHANES is a national survey that assesses the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States through interviews, physical examinations, and laboratory tests. The analysis will use body mass index (BMI), age, gender, height, weight, waist circumference and smoking status as predictor variables for average systolic blood pressure.

## External Resources

The final report and code were written by Susan Peck.

The following resources were used for preliminary research:

-   NHANES (<https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?BeginYear=2017>)
-   ChatGPT
-   ClaudeAI
-   Google search AI answers

Search Engines and ChatGPT were to verify that I was not missing crucial information, to debug code or figure out what an error meant, and as a thesaurus when I used the word "suggests" one too many times or my prose was awkward and I needed suggestions. I also used Claude to type up my .bib from my sources in the proper format.
